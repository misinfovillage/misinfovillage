## Introduction

### OUR MISSION

The Misinformation Village is a collaborative of dis- and misinformation researchers, data analysts and computer linguists, cybersecurity and defence professionals, and all like-minded professionals across academia, civil society, government and industry.

We seek to establish open and broad-sector frameworks to define, expose, analyze and counter the security challenges of misinformation and disinformation campaigns on democratic regimes, free markets, public trust, and open and progressive societies.

### WHY OPEN FRAMEWORKS?

Open frameworks and open data infrastructure enhance and promote the production of scientific knowledge and industry expertise as they enable collaboration, information sharing, transparency, and reproducibility. 

We aim to provide a common "space" for researchers to share data, tools, and knowledge, information, context, story, you name it leading to more accurate, fuller, richer, trusted research outcomes, better-informed policy decisions, and innovative solutions to complex problems. Diverse and inclusive research outcomes will ensure the benefits of scientific progress are shared widely, and so it means diverse speakers, unorthodox ideas and unfinished projects. By supporting open frameworks, we strive to accelerate scientific discovery, innovation, and create a more collaborative space for professionals and audience members activated in this space.
